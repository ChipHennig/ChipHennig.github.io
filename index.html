    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Hi! I'm a bachelor's in computer science graduate ('23)
        from the <a href="https://www.msoe.edu/">Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE)</a>.
        There I received a data science oriented curriculum and
        applied that experience at various internships and projects.
        As of now, I'm currently enrolled in an <a
            href="https://bulletin.marquette.edu/graduate/data-science-ms/#requirementstext">
            M.S. Data Science program at Marquette University</a> and looking
        for full-time and internship roles in data science/analytics and software engineering.
        In my free time I like to play music (piano, trumpet, & guitar), read fiction,
        and play games or sports.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I have done multiple internships in software development and data science,
        which you can read about more in my <a href="christian_hennig.pdf">resume.</a>
        Companies I have worked at include <a href="https://www.mcw.edu/departments/center-for-advancing-population-science-caps">The Medical College of Wisconsin</a>,
        <a href="https://circaworks.com/">Circa</a>, and <a href="https://www.directsupply.com/">Direct Supply</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        At MSOE I received a <a href="https://catalog.msoe.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=40&poid=2045&returnto=1396">hands-on</a> curriculum that was formative in my learning
        of software development, but also in applied mathematics, theory, and practice
        for data science. Some example projects from those courses included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>An <a href="gtfs.png">MVC application</a> which processed, tabulated, and visualized
            Milwaukee bus route data using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTFS">GTFS specification.</a>
            Tech used: Java, Git
        </li>
        <li>
            An <a href="https://github.com/ChipHennig/group6_discoveryworld_CNN/tree/main">emotion recognition computer vision application</a> trained on the 
            <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/affectnet">AffectNet</a> dataset. 
            Adjustment of class proportions was done to address underperformance due to 
            demographic bias. Tech used: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Jupyter notebook
        </li>
        <li>
            A <a href="https://github.com/jwmke/cs4981-cuda-encryption">parallized implementation of AES and RSA</a> algorithms with significant
            speed up times. Tech used: CUDA C
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other projects</h3>

    <p>During our senior year, my senior design project teammates and I worked on an
        experimental end-to-end AI robotics engine. The software didn't make it to the 
        VEXU World Championship, but we presented it at the <a href="https://www.wspe.org/discovery-conference">WSPE Discovery Conference</a> and won <a href="https://www.msoe.edu/about-msoe/news/details/msoe-students-awarded-in-first-ever-rosie-supercomputer-super-challenge/">MSOE's 
        first supercomputer challenge.</a></p>
    

    A recent project I undertook when learning about LLMs is a <a href="https://gamerec.app/">game recommendation</a>
    website. You can find out more about it on the <a href="https://github.com/ChipHennig/dspy-gamerec?tab=readme-ov-file">code repository</a> and 
    a <a href="https://chip-hennig.medium.com/list/prompt-engineering-with-dspy-for-game-recommendations-0721588eaad5">couple blogs I wrote</a>.

    <p>While taking a gap year after graduating, I started a blog
        on Substack where I regularly published articles about
        history, rhetoric, and new developments in technology.
